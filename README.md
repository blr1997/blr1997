Coding Problem Assignment 

prerequsite:
1.To install node js.
2.To run js file use: node js fileName.

# The provided code problem addresses the need for a data structure that maintains and manages recently played songs for different users, 
while handling storage constraints and maintaining the correct order of song plays and also added Exception handling concept to catch the run time error in the running code.

# We can learn including problem solving, data management, algorithm design, and code organization, Exception handling.

#These test cases cover scenarios logic such as:
1. Playing songs for a user.
2. Ensuring the store respects its storage by removing the least recently played song.
3. Retrieving recently played songs for different users.
4. Handling cases where a user hasn't played any songs.
5. Testing multiple users with their own song histories.
6. Running these tests should help you verify the correctness of your RecentlyPlayedStore implementation.
